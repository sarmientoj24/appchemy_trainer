# Abstract
The author proposes using Variational Autoencoders (VAE) where the author exploits its capability to regularisethe latent space for generating new samples from the distribution and to generate a latent representation of data as features and introduces two methods in utilizing the latent variables
for similar image retrieval, recommendation. This enables a base framework that can be used for the e-commerce industry that implements collaborative design for product styles, product clustering, image retrieval and recommender systems using only one architecture to solve multiple problems.
